# ContentGPT

ContentGPT is an AI application built on top of OpenAI LLM models that allows the user to connect to Pinecone for long term memory storage, enabling the AI to personalise and tailor the responses to a user's prompts based on the content the user uploaded to their Pinecone index.

The vision is to create an autonomous AI which can produce and distrubute original, viral, creative content all by itself, acting as an independant media machine. 

Currently the software is in the early development stage.
